# Data Model: Digital Twin Simulation for Humanoid Robots

## Key Entities

### Digital Twin
- **Definition**: Virtual representation of a physical humanoid robot that mirrors its behavior, state, and characteristics in real-time
- **Attributes**:
  - virtual_model: 3D representation of the physical robot
  - state_data: Current position, orientation, sensor readings
  - behavior_model: How the digital twin responds to inputs
  - synchronization_status: Connection status with physical robot (if applicable)
- **Relationships**: Links to Simulation Environment and Humanoid Robot Model

### Simulation Environment
- **Definition**: Virtual space containing terrain, obstacles, and interaction elements that influence robot behavior
- **Attributes**:
  - environment_type: Indoor, outdoor, specific scenario
  - terrain_properties: Friction, surface type, physical characteristics
  - obstacle_definitions: Static and dynamic obstacles in the environment
  - physics_parameters: Gravity, air resistance, material properties
  - lighting_conditions: For Unity rendering
- **Relationships**: Contains Humanoid Robot Model, connects to Digital Twin

### Sensor Data Stream
- **Definition**: Continuous flow of information from virtual sensors (LiDAR, depth camera, IMU) to ROS 2 nodes
