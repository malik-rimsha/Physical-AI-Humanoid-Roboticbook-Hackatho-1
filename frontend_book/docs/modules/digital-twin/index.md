# Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

Welcome to Module 2 of the Physical AI Humanoid Robotics Course! This module focuses on digital twin concepts and physics-based simulation for humanoid robots using Gazebo and Unity.

## Overview

In this module, you will learn about:

- What digital twins are in robotics
- Physics simulation with gravity and collisions in Gazebo
- Building robot environments in Gazebo
- High-fidelity rendering and interaction in Unity
- Sensor simulation (LiDAR, depth cameras, IMUs)
- Sensor data flow into ROS 2 systems
- Preparing perception pipelines for AI modules

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

1. Understand the concept of digital twins in robotics and their importance in simulation
2. Create physics-based simulations in Gazebo with realistic gravity and collision detection
3. Build custom robot environments in Gazebo and experience high-fidelity rendering in Unity
4. Simulate various sensors (LiDAR, depth cameras, IMUs) and connect them to ROS 2 systems
5. Prepare perception pipelines for AI modules using simulated sensor data

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of robotics concepts
- Completion of Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)
- Familiarity with Linux/Ubuntu environment

## Getting Started

This module is divided into three main chapters, each building on the previous one:

1. **Chapter 1**: Digital Twins and Physics Simulation
2. **Chapter 2**: Environment & Interaction Simulation
3. **Chapter 3**: Sensor Simulation

Let's begin with understanding digital twin concepts and physics simulation in Gazebo!
